nvcOf course. Using a normal web browser on an iPhone or iPad (like Safari or Chrome), you can build and deploy this entire site using GitHub Codespaces. It's a cloud-based development environment that runs in your browser—no local setup needed.

Here is the complete, step-by-step guide to get Joe Sanders' website and simulator live from your iPad.

---

Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository

1. On your iPad, open Safari/Chrome and go to github.com.
2. Log in to your account.
3. Click the + icon in the top-right and select "New repository".
4. Name it joe-sanders-golf.
5. Set it to Public (required for free Codespaces hours).
6. Check "Add a README file".
7. Click "Create repository".

---

Step 2: Launch Your Cloud Development Environment (Codespaces)

1. Inside your new joe-sanders-golf repository, click the "Code" button.
2. Select the "Codespaces" tab.
3. Click "Create codespace on main".

Your browser will now open a full-fledged Visual Studio Code environment that is running on GitHub's servers. It looks and works exactly like the desktop app, but in your iPad's browser.

Step 3: Build the Website (In Your Browser)

Now, use the terminal inside Codespaces to run commands.

1. Create the Next.js Project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

(Type `y` when it asks to overwrite the existing files.)

2. Install Required Packages: Copy and paste this single command into the terminal to install everything needed:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr stripe next-auth @radix-ui/react-dialog lucide-react
```

3. Create the Folder Structure: Use the file explorer in the left sidebar to create these folders:

· src/components/
· src/lib/
· src/types/
· src/app/api/ (Then create webhooks/ and newsletter/ inside api/)
· public/images/
· public/videos/

4. Set Up Environment Variables:

· In the file explorer, create a new file called .env.local.
· Add your keys (you'll get these from Supabase & Stripe dashboards):

```bash
# Get these from https://supabase.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Get this from https://stripe.com
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
```

5. Build the Core Pages: Create these files in src/app/:

· page.tsx (Homepage)
· simulator/page.tsx (The Golf Game)
· journey/page.tsx
· shop/page.tsx
· sponsorship/page.tsx

(I will provide the code for these files in a follow-up message. You can copy-paste them directly.)

6. Initialize Git and Push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Build initial website with simulator"
git push
```

Your code is now saved on GitHub.

Step 4: Set Up the Required Services

1. Supabase (Database & Auth):
   · Go to supabase.com and create a free project.
   · Go to the SQL Editor and run the SQL commands I will provide to create the profiles, scores, and tournaments tables.
   · Find your API keys in Settings > API and add them to your Codespace .env.local file.
2. Stripe (Payments):
   · Go to stripe.com and create a free account.
   · Find your API keys in Developers > API keys and add them to .env.local.
   · In Developers > Webhooks, add an endpoint URL. It will be https://your-url.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe (you'll get the URL after deploying in Step 5).

---

Step 5: Deploy to the Internet with Vercel

1. In a new browser tab, go to vercel.com.
2. Sign up with your GitHub account.
3. Click "Add New... > Project".
4. Find your joe-sanders-golf repository and click "Import".
5. In the "Configure Project" screen, add your Environment Variables from .env.local.
6. Click "Deploy".

In under 60 seconds, your site will be live on the internet with a public URL (like `joe-sanders-golf.vercel.app`).

Summary: What You Just Did

1. Created a repo on GitHub.
2. Opened a professional code editor in your browser (Codespaces).
3. Built a modern website with a terminal and editor.
4. Connected a database (Supabase) and payment system (Stripe).
5. Deployed it globally (Vercel).

All from your iPad's web browser, with no other hardware or software required.

Would you like me to provide the specific code for the page.tsx and simulator/page.tsx files next? This will bring the Uncle Joe brand and the golf game to life.
