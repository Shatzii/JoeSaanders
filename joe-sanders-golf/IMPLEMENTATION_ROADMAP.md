- [ ] Configure proper error boundaries

### 1.2 Resolve Test Suite
- [ ] Fix Winston logger mocking in tests
- [ ] Resolve Request API issues in API tests
- [ ] Add proper test environment configuration
- [ ] Ensure 80%+ test coverage on critical paths

### 1.3 Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create `.env.local` template with safe defaults
- [ ] Add environment validation utility
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for missing services
- [ ] Document minimum required environment variables

---

## Phase 2: Deployment Readiness (Week 2)
**Goal**: Enable production deployment

### 2.1 Production Build Pipeline
- [ ] Fix all static generation issues
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and performance
- [ ] Add proper build validation scripts
- [ ] Configure production monitoring

### 2.2 Security Hardening
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for all API routes
- [ ] Add request validation middleware
- [ ] Configure proper CORS and security headers
- [ ] Add rate limiting to all public endpoints

### 2.3 Database & External Services
- [ ] Test with real Supabase instance
- [ ] Validate all API integrations
- [ ] Add proper fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Implement health checks for all services

---

## Phase 3: Missing Enterprise Features (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Implement documented but missing features

### 3.1 GDPR Compliance Suite
- [ ] Implement granular cookie consent controls
- [ ] Add user data export functionality
- [ ] Create consent management dashboard
- [ ] Add data retention and deletion policies

### 3.2 Advanced Monitoring
- [ ] Configure Sentry alerts and dashboards
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Add business metrics tracking
- [ ] Create admin analytics dashboard

### 3.3 CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
- [ ] Add security scanning (npm audit, Snyk)
- [ ] Implement automated testing on PR
- [ ] Add deployment approvals and rollbacks
- [ ] Configure multi-environment setup

---

## Phase 4: Performance & Optimization (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Achieve enterprise-grade performance

### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize images and assets
- [ ] Add CDN configuration
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies

### 4.2 PWA Features
- [ ] Create service worker for offline functionality
- [ ] Implement push notifications
- [ ] Add home screen installation
- [ ] Create PWA manifest

### 4.3 Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement subscription tiers
- [ ] Add advanced analytics
- [ ] Create sponsor ROI dashboard
- [ ] Build fan engagement features

## Resource Requirements

### Technical:
- Development environment setup time: 2-4 hours
- External service accounts (Supabase, Auth0, Stripe, etc.)
- Domain name for production deployment
- Monitoring service setup (Sentry)

### Testing:
- Real user testing on production environment
- Performance testing with realistic data loads
- Security testing and vulnerability scanning
- Cross-browser and mobile device testing

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items:
1. **Build System Issues**: May require architectural changes
   - *Mitigation*: Gradual SSR -> CSR conversion for problematic components
2. **External Service Dependencies**: May hit rate limits or costs
   - *Mitigation*: Implement robust fallback mechanisms
3. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Complex features may impact speed
   - *Mitigation*: Implement performance budgets and monitoring

### Medium Risk Items:
1. **Test Environment Setup**: May require significant configuration
2. **GDPR Implementation**: Legal compliance requirements complex
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Different devices may have unique issues

---

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Start with Phase 1.1**: Fix the build system to enable deployment
2. **Set up basic environment**: Create working `.env.local` with test credentials
3. **Run health checks**: Validate current functionality with minimal setup
4. **Document current state**: Update roadmap docs to reflect reality

This plan provides a realistic path from the current 65% completion to the documented 90% enterprise readiness level.
