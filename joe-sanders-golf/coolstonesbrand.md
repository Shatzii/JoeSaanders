lPerfect — we’re building CoolStones (the lifestyle expansion of Stones Golf) into a site that feels like Nike x Jordan Brand x Roc Nation. The dev doesn’t just need “a landing page.” They need the brand architecture, content playbook, and wireframe DNA to build the ultimate experience. Here’s the blueprint you hand off:
